# Obsidian Asana Plugin
How about we make it possible to import Asana tasks into Obsidian. Note, this is still an early version.

### Features

- Search (and import) followed tasks
- Auto replace links and generate pages.


### Instructions
- Install the plugin from the Community Plugins tab.
- Activate **Asana Sync** in the Community Plugins tab.
- Fill out the required fields and setup the connection.
- Assign keybindings or use the implemented commands.

### Dependencies
Install the [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/Snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title) plugin for the best experience.

### Helpfull Tips
If you're using [Filename Heading Sync](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync), you can add a blacklist with the following RegEx: `.*\.asana\.md`.

### Credits
The [sample plugin (by Obsidian)](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) was used as the basis for this project
