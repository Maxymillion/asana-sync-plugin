# Obsidian Asana Plugin
How about we make it possible to import Asana tasks into Obsidian. Note, this is still an early version. Originally built for me and my colleagues to easily gain insight into Asana tasks set for that specific day.

# NOTE! This plugin is getting rebuilt!
**I've learned quite a bit from publishing my Zen plugin. Many of the "tricks" in this repo aren't the ones recommended by Obsdian.md's devs. I'll delete this repo as soon as I've build al the functionalities into the new one, which can be found here [Asana](https://github.com/Maxymillion/obsidian-asana)**

### Features
- Search (and import) assigned tasks
- Search (and import) followed tasks
- Auto replace links and generate pages.

### Instructions
- Install the plugin from the Community Plugins tab.
- Activate **Asana Sync** in the Community Plugins tab.
- Fill out the required fields and setup the connection.
- Assign keybindings or use the implemented commands.

### Dependencies
Install the [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/Snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title) plugin for the best experience.

### Helpfull Tips
If you're using [Filename Heading Sync](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync), it would be wise to add the following RegEx: `.*\.asana\.md` to the blacklist.

### Credits
The [sample plugin (by Obsidian)](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) was used as the basis for this project
