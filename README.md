# Obsidian Asana Plugin
How about we make it possible to import Asana tasks into Obsidian. Note, this is still an early version.

### Features
- Search (and import) assigned tasks
- Search (and import) followed tasks
- Auto replace links and generate pages.

### Dependencies
Best experience with the [Front Matter Title](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-front-matter-title-plugin) plugin.

### Credits
The [sample plugin (by Obsidian)](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) was used as the basis for this project
